# web-project
This is a web project for ACM Month of Code 2020 (April)

I have created an online Food Delivery web service specializing in three different food items. I have completed both client-side and server-side development. 

For client-side development, I have used HTML 5, external CSS and basic JavaScript for form validation, whereas for the server-side development, I have used PHP and MySQL database using Xampp server.
